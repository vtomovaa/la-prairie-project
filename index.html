            <p>
                In 2023, the pioneering scientists at La Prairie take the next step in lifting and firming to focus
                on the very life within the skin. Fusing the newly developed Caviar Micro-Nutrients with Caviar
                Premier for the first time, the remastered Skin Caviar Luxe Cream aims to support skin's metabolism
                and ultimately restore its youthful structure.
                <br>Over time, skin is infused with new life, lifted,
                firmed and smoothed. The signature cobalt blue colour of the jar, inspired by artist Niki de Saint
                Phalle, is re-designed as a lighter vessel using recycled and recyclable glass.
                The new La Prairie Skin Caviar Luxe Cream helps support the skin’s metabolism and visibly restore
                the skin's structure.
                <br>Now, with daily application, Skin Caviar Luxe Cream works to lift the face skin and enhance its
                firmness and elasticity.
                Fine lines are reduced.

            Caviar’s benefits are strengthened and magnified.
            The skin around the eye appears lifted and firmed, resulting in a total transformation.
            Features are supported, tightened and toned, while the look of puffiness is diminished.
            <br>The delicate skin of the lower and upper lids is deeply moisturised, leaving it with a feeling of
            unparalleled comfort.
            The iconic sensorial experience features a modern interpretation of Skin Caviar’s signature fragrance and a
            silky texture that glides on effortlessly before vanishing into skin

        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="faq-title">Does this product contain SPF? </h3>
            <p class="faq-p">No, this product does not contain spf. We have
                opted for not mixing Retinol with UV and UVB protection in the same product to avoid any kind of
                interaction (the combination of products that contain bio active ingredients can alter or
                neutralize their effects). What we always suggest is to apply sunscreen after the neck
                moisturizer has been absorbed and to apply in general sunscreen regardless of the cosmetic
                product that you are using. If you plan to spend a long time exposed to the sun, then it is
                better to apply the neck moisturizer only at PM.

            <h3 class="faq-title">Is it useful for dark spots on the neck?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p">Yes, the concentration of active ingredients, especially Retinol and
                Peptides, allow the cells to turn over faster and to produce more collagen therefore
                contributing to clearer and more even skin

        <div class="question">
            <h3 class="faq-title">Does retinol cause redness?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p">Retinol is a powerful and effective anti-aging ingredient. The
                percentage contained in the neck cream is moderate however, if it is your first time using
                Retinol, to avoid common side effects, such as slight redness or dryness, we encourage to start
                off with a gradual introduction in your skin care so that your skin can adjust to the ingredient
                while enjoying its extraordinary properties. Once your skin had adjusted to the product, you can
                switch to the once/twice a day application.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">Can I use the product everyday?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p">If you have used Retinol before, you can use the product on a daily
                basis. In all other cases, we advise to start gradually in order for your skin to enjoy the
                beneficial properties of this ingredient while also allowing to adjust to it.

                            I was surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference. It also has a nice green tea
                            aroma. I'll buy it again when I've used it up. I bought the combo with the eye cream to
                            get rid of the dark circles <br>around my eyes and made an immediate difference.

                            happy surprise! It goes on clean and fresh, not a bit greasy and refreshes all night or
                            day. I even used <br>it before I shaved one morning and the razor glided across my face with
                            no burn. I love this stuff.</p>

                            It has totally <br>changed my skin, which visibly looks tighter especially the little lines
                            around my eyes. I love putting it on under my make up in the morning for work and every

                            anti aging retinol moisturizer is just the right combination of rigor and gentle for my
                            aging skin. I am 62 <br>and I tried Kleem products without expectations or hope; as is usual
                            for me. I haven't been using the Kleem products long (2 weeks) but I see positive
                            results. My skin is radiant. My wrinkles are <br>less significant. My skin seems thinner.
